Chore: Site-wide branding configuration
  As a site owner, I want to be able to re-brand Kajoo to suit my city.

  Scenario: Site-wide branding configuration

  Given I have cloned the kajoo repo
  When I enter all the required configuration fields in config/site.yml
  And I start to a new server
  Then I should be able to view a kajoo localized to my city
